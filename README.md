### Where's the Social Media??

Around 4 years ago I fell out of favor with Facebook, opting instead to use Instagram for sharing photos, updates, ideas. However, I've more recently dropped IG, as well, for 2 reasons:

1. the psychological affects on our community's social well-being
2. my views towards Facebook's data and privacy policies

But my general attitude is the same towards other platforms such as Reddit and TikTok, etc.

As somebody who is interested in tech development, I am torn by staying outside of "the circle" and oblivious to the innovations and trends; but ignorance can be bliss. I recognize that it is on my to stay up-to-date with general trends and conditions and maintaining awareness of the latest tools and tricks.
